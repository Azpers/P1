                <h2>Passion</h2>
                    <p>Where to start, as important as it is to make time on a day to study, learn, and be better it’s even more important to do something that will de stress your head and make you start fresh every time you'll get back to the desk.</p>
                    <p>I've been a long time gamer and sportsman all my life, since I was around 12 years old I played World of Warcraft and when I wasn't killing moster's or enemy player's I was playing basketball.</p>
                    <p>As I grew older I stopped enjoying the endless grind of mmo's and I grabbed a game called League of Legends which you start over every time you play a game so it's not as time consuming, and whenever I want to get that WoW’s vibe there's a great game called Path of Exile that fills that void without having to invest that much time on it.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays when I'm not playing game's I've discovered that not only eating good is something that I've always loved but also cooking! Reading books, following tutorials on internet or even videos I've learned a great deal of dishes and cooking skills I couldn't even imagine possible. Can't start talking about this topic without making a 5 pages long essay so we'll leave it at <strong>cooking rocks!</strong></p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I'm being very straightforward with my goals this year, right now I have an objective that’s to get my <em>techdegree</em> as a <strong>F</strong>ront <strong>E</strong>nd <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>D</strong>eveloper so I can start getting a job as a junior web developer!</p>
                    <P>Currently working hard to get good and one day master:</P>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I've always played with the idea of coding, programming, web design or however you want to call it. </p>
                    <p>Somehow even if it interested me and got me to take peak on that foreign world.. Every time it grabbed my attention there was something dull about just writing endless line's of code on a web editor just to get a site to opearte that really made me end up quitting.</p>
                    <p>With time and a lot of thought I've realized that actually programming and coding is not really what we're here for but what can you make with it, just as a painter is not in his profession for a cute looking paint pen or an architech just fell in love with a bevel.</p>
                    <p>When you're making a website you're giving life to a concept, to what was before just an idea and if you can't see the beauty on that then there's nothing else I can say to make you understand my decission on becomming a full time web designer!</p>
